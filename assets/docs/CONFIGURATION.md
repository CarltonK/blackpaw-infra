# üßæ Odoo Community Edition Server Setup

This guide outlines the steps and requirements for setting up an Odoo Community Edition instance on a production-grade server. This setup assumes a clean Debian 11 installation and includes secure user setup, SSH access, and Odoo installation via an automated script.

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- **OS:** Debian 11 (Bullseye)
- **User setup:** Secure, non-root sudo user
- **Access:** SSH keys (no password login)
- **Odoo setup:** Automated via `odoo_setup.sh` script (included in this repository at assets/scripts)

## üõ†Ô∏è 1. Initial Server Setup
Follow the DigitalOcean guide below to create a **non-root user** with `sudo` privileges and configure a basic firewall:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Replace `ubuntu` with `debian` where applicable.


If ufw is not installed, then install with
```bash
apt install ufw
```
